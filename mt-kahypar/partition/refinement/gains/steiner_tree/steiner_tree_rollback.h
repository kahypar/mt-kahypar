/**
 * In our FM algorithm, we recompute the gain values of all node moves in the global move
 * sequence M := <m_1, ..., m_l> in parallel (see global_rollback.h). Each node move m_i
 * is of the form (u, V_i, V_j), which means that node u is moved from block V_i to block
 * V_j. Each node in this sequence is moved at most once. Moreover, we assume that all
 * node moves with an index < i are performed before m_i.
 *
 * The parallel gain recomputation algorithm iterates over all hyperedges e \in E in
 * parallel. We then iterate over the pins of e and compute some auxilliary data based on
 * which we then decide if we attribute an increase or reduction by w(e) to a moved pin.
 * This class implements the functions required by the rollback algorithm to recompute all
 * gain values for the connectivity metric.
