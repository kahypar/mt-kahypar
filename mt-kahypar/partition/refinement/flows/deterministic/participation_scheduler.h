/**
 * Implements the participation scheduling strategy.
 * The participation block scheduling strategy proceeds in rounds. In each round,
 * all active edges of the quotient graph are scheduled for refinement as a series
 * of matchings. Each matching is determined greedily, where the first criterion is
 * to select a node with maximum participation (i.e., the degree restricted to active
 * edges). Then, the edge with highest previous improvement is selected. Matchings
 * are processed one by one, so that scheduled edges can't interfere with other edges.
 *
 * A edge is called active, if at least one of the blocks is active and a block
 * is called active if a refinement involving that block in the previous round
 * lead to an improvement.
