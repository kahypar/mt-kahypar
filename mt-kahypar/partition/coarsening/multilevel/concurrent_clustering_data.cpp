   * We maintain the invariant during clustering that each cluster has a unique
   * representative and all vertices in the cluster point to that representative.
   * Let v be the representative of a cluster C_v, then for all nodes u \in C_v
   * follows that cluster_ids[u] = v.
   * If we perform sequential clustering, we can simply set
   * cluster_ids[u] = cluster_ids[v] to maintain our invariant. However,
   * things become more complicated if we perform parallel clustering.
   * Especially, if two neighbors u and v are concurrently matched, we have
   * to guarantee that our clustering fullfils our invariant. There are mainly
   * two different cases, which needs special attention:
   *   1.) u is matched with v and v is matched with u concurrently
   *   2.) u is matched with v and v is matched with another vertex w concurrently

  // During the clustering, there are concurrent memory accesses to the following 4 locations:
  // _matching_state, cluster_ids, _matching_partner and _cluster_weight.
  // We use _matching_state to synchronize accesses to cluster_ids with acquire/release semantics, while
  // _matching_partner and _cluster_weight don't require synchronization. In more detail (see also PR #193):
  //   1. We read cluster_ids[v] to determine the representative for joinCluster if v is already matched.
  //      This is synchronized by using release ordering when writing the MATCHED state to _matching_state
  //      and always checking _matching_state[v] with acquire ordering before accessing cluster_ids[v]
  //   2. _matching_partner is used for conflict resolution. Since the conflict resolution loops until
  //      a stable state is detected, no explicit synchronization is necessary and relaxed ordering suffices
  //   3. Updating _cluster_weight might cause a race condition in joinCluster. However, this just causes the
